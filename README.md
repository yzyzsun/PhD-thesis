### How to Build?

Simply `make` should work.

Please make sure that the `listings` package has a newer version than 1.10b (2024/05/25), otherwise you will encounter an error because `language={[3]Python}` is not supported in older versions.

You may need to install [Ott](https://github.com/ott-lang/ott) if you want to build from scratch.
