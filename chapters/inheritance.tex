\chapter{Type-Safe Dynamic Inheritance} \label{ch:inheritance}

This chapter presents the second case study of compositional programming:
type-safe dynamic inheritance. While dynamic inheritance is supported by many
dynamically typed languages, such as JavaScript, it poses significant challenges
for statically typed languages to implement it in a type-safe manner. We
identify an \emph{inexact superclass problem}, revealing a type-safety issue in
TypeScript, which extends JavaScript with static typing. Then we show how CP
solves this problem via \emph{merging}. In short, CP supports dynamic multiple
inheritance and family polymorphism while preserving type safety.
