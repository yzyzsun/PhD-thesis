\chapter{Type-Safe Dynamic Inheritance} \label{ch:inheritance}

This chapter presents the second case study of compositional programming:
type-safe dynamic inheritance. While dynamic inheritance is supported by many
dynamically typed languages, such as JavaScript, it poses significant challenges
for statically typed languages to implement it in a type-safe manner.
\autoref{sec:introduction} starts with a manifesto of our proposal based on a
trait model with merging. Then in \autoref{sec:background}, we show some
concrete examples in TypeScript, which extends JavaScript with static typing,
revealing type-safety issues. Finally in \autoref{sec:overview}, we show how CP
solves these issues. In short, CP supports dynamic multiple inheritance and
family polymorphism while preserving type safety.
