\chapter{Named Arguments as Intersections, Optional Arguments as Unions} \label{ch:arguments}

Named and optional arguments are prevalent features in many mainstream
programming languages, enhancing code readability and flexibility. Despite
widespread use, their formalization has not been extensively studied.

This part extends compositional programming with union types, enabling a
type-safe foundation for named and optional arguments. We show how our encoding
resolves a critical type-safety issue found in popular static type checkers for
Python and Ruby, particularly in handling first-class named arguments in the
presence of subtyping. Our approach is formalized through an elaboration from a
functional language with named and optional arguments (\uaena) to a minimal core
calculus with intersection and union types (\lambdaiu).
