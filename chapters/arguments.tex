\chapter{Named Arguments as Intersections, Optional Arguments as Unions} \label{ch:arguments}

Named and optional arguments are prevalent features in many mainstream
programming languages, enhancing code readability and flexibility. Despite
widespread use, their formalization has not been extensively studied.

This part extends compositional programming with union types, enabling a
type-safe foundation for named and optional arguments. We first conduct a survey
of existing languages' support for named arguments in \autoref{sec:existing}.
Then we identify in \autoref{sec:bad} a critical type-safety issue in popular
static type checkers for Python and Ruby, particularly in handling first-class
named arguments in the presence of subtyping. Our solution is informally
presented in \autoref{sec:type-safe} and formalized in \autoref{sec:iu-uaena}
through an elaboration from a functional language with named and optional
arguments (\uaena) to a minimal core calculus with intersection and union types
(\lambdaiu). We conclude this chapter with a detailed discussion of existing
designs in \autoref{sec:related}.
