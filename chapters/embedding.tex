\chapter{Compositional Embeddings of Domain-Specific Languages} \label{ch:embedding}

This chapter presents the second case study: compositional embeddings of
domain-specific languages (DSLs). We concentrate on how to embed DSLs in a
modular way and compose them to build larger DSLs. We start with an introduction
to the problem that we aim to solve in \autoref{sec:problem}. Then we
demonstrate existing embedding techniques in \autoref{sec:embed} and show in
\autoref{sec:lang} that \emph{compositional embeddings} combine the advantages
of shallow and deep embeddings and surpasses other techniques like tagless-final
embeddings by supporting modular dependencies. We validate our approach by
showcasing a compositionally embedded DSL for document authoring in
\autoref{sec:dsl} and further evaluating it in \autoref{sec:evaluation}.
