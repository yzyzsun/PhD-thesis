\chapter{Compositional Embeddings of Domain-Specific Languages} \label{ch:embedding}

In this part, we illustrate why compositional programming matters with two case
studies. The first one is its application to domain-specific languages (DSLs),
which is the focus of this chapter. We show how to embed DSLs in a modular way
and compose them to build larger DSLs. This \emph{compositional embedding}
approach leverages the strengths of both shallow and deep embeddings and
essentially solves the \emph{expression problem} for embedded DSLs. We validate
our approach by showcasing a compositionally embedded DSL for document authoring
called \ExT.
