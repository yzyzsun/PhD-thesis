\chapter{Compositional Embeddings of Domain-Specific Languages} \label{ch:embedding}

In this part, we illustrate why compositional programming matters with two case
studies. The first one is its application to domain-specific languages (DSLs),
which is the focus of this chapter. We concentrate on how to embed DSLs in a
modular way and compose them to build larger DSLs. We first introduce existing
embedding techniques and their limitations in \autoref{sec:embed}. Then we show
in \autoref{sec:lang} that \emph{compositional embeddings} leverage the
strengths of both shallow and deep embeddings and essentially solves the
\emph{expression problem} for embedded DSLs. We validate our approach by
showcasing a compositionally embedded DSL for document authoring called \ExT in
\autoref{sec:dsl} and further evaluating it in \autoref{sec:evaluation}.
